# Noh

Noh is a fictional programming language to be used for hypnosis sessions.
It is not designed to be run by computers, but humans (referred to as "Noh interpreters").
It is not created for computer programmers, but hypnotists (referred to as "the user").
The intent of Noh is to have a plausibly real programming language that implements the desired feature set for a hypnosis session.

This project and many of its concepts are heavily based on [Nous](https://github.com/CodeWithNous/Nous), with the following misson statements:

* Make it compatible with a syntax highlighter for an existing language.
* Avoid syntax that causes ambiguity, or otherwise looks outdated.
* Expand the standard library.

# The name "Noh"

Noh (能) is a form of Japanese theater, and also a homophone of the Japanese word for "brain" (脳).

# Documentation

# Rules of the fiction

* Noh scripts may be run "from standard input" (i.e. through a text chat service of choosing). Alternatively, a `.noh` file can be run from the command line, like `noh hello.noh`.
* Due to a reliance on countless implicit assumptions that come with Noh interpreters being humans, there may never be a computer program that reliably interprets Noh code.
* Due to the subjective nature of Noh interpreters, the result of Noh code may differ from implementation to implementation.
* Due to the lack of fast file transfer methods into Noh interpreters, there are no installable programs for the purpose of interpreting Noh. Living entities gradually learn to interpret Noh, the same way a Noh programmer learns to code in Noh.

# Contribution guidelines

If you want to propose a concept or function to be added to Noh, please make a pull request to the repository with your desired addition documented as a `.md` file. The Noh team may work with you to improve the implementation, or reject certain ideas.
